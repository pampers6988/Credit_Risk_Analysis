# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Loan prediction risk analysis:
### Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Employed imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models with unbalanced classes
### Oversampling
- Oversampling of Naive and with SMOTE did not yield a usable model
Naive confusion matrix
 array([[   70,    31],
       [ 6813, 10291]]
